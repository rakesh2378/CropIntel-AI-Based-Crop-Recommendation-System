## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning–based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.  
It helps farmers make data-driven decisions using AI/ML techniques.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers often face difficulty in selecting the right crop due to lack of scientific guidance on soil nutrients and climate conditions.  
This project aims to solve that problem by predicting the best crop using machine learning.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The system takes input parameters such as:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH value
- Rainfall  

Based on these inputs, a trained ML model predicts the most suitable crop.
